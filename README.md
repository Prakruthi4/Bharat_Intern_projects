#Task 1 - Wine_quality_prediction

Wine quality prediction is a fascinating application of machine learning that involves using historical data to predict the quality of wines based on their characteristics.The core idea of linear regression is to find a linear equation that best represents the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.By training the model on a labeled dataset of wine samples, we aim to predict the quality of new wines based on their chemical composition.

#Task 2 -  House_price_prediction 

House price prediction is a crucial application of machine learning that involves estimating the market value of a house based on various features or attributes. Linear regression, a foundational machine learning algorithm, can be employed to model the relationship between these features and the predicted house prices.

#Task 3 - Iris_flower_classification_

Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their features, Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica.  In the case of iris flower classification, SVM aims to find the optimal decision boundary that separates the different species based on their features. Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees during training and combines their predictions for classification.
